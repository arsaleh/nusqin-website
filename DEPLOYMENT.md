## 📋 Pre-Deployment Checklist

- [x] Git repository initialized
- [x] All changes committed
- [x] HubSpot integration configured
- [x] Environment variables documented
- [x] Build tested locally (`npm run build`)
- [ ] Choose deployment platform (Vercel/Railway)
- [ ] Set up custom domain (optional)

## 🔧 Environment Variables

Both platforms will need these environment variables (already configured in code):

```env
# HubSpot Configuration (already in lib/constants.ts)
NEXT_PUBLIC_HUBSPOT_PORTAL_ID=342690538
NEXT_PUBLIC_HUBSPOT_FORM_ID=c82125ae-3b06-457e-a9c2-e87e26c2cd4a
```

These are already hardcoded in `lib/constants.ts`, so no additional environment setup is needed unless you want to make them configurable.

## 🧪 Test Build Locally

Before deploying, test the production build:

```bash
cd /Users/arsl/code/beauty-clinic/nusqin-website

# Build the project
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start

# View at http://localhost:3000
```

## 🌐 Custom Domain Setup

### Vercel
1. Go to Project Settings → Domains
2. Add your domain (e.g., `nusqin.com`)
3. Update DNS records as instructed
4. Wait for DNS propagation (up to 48 hours)

### Railway
1. Go to Project Settings
2. Click "Generate Domain" for Railway subdomain
3. Or add custom domain in "Custom Domains" section
4. Update DNS records as instructed

## 📊 Post-Deployment

1. **Test all pages:**
   - Homepage (/)
   - All 8 treatment pages (/treatments/[slug])
   - Contact page (/contact)
   - About section

2. **Verify HubSpot form:**
   - Submit a test form submission
   - Check HubSpot portal for the test contact

## 🔄 Rollback Instructions

If you need to rollback to the previous version:

```bash
cd /Users/arsl/code/beauty-clinic/nusqin-website

# View commit history
git log --oneline

# Rollback to previous commit (before luxury redesign)
git reset --hard HEAD~1

# Or rollback to specific commit
git reset --hard <commit-hash>

# Force push to remote (if already deployed)
git push -f origin main
```

Current saved commit: `968e789` - Complete MedSpa luxury redesign

## 📝 Deployment URLs

After deployment, update this section with your live URLs:

- **Production URL:** [To be added after deployment]
- **Preview URL:** [Auto-generated by platform]
- **Repository:** `/Users/arsl/code/beauty-clinic/nusqin-website`

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Build Failures

If build fails, check:
1. `npm run build` works locally
2. All dependencies in `package.json`
3. No TypeScript errors
4. Image URLs are accessible

### Images Not Loading

If external images (nusqin.com) don't load:
1. Check `next.config.ts` has correct `remotePatterns`
2. Verify image URLs are still valid
3. Check browser console for errors

### Form Not Submitting

If HubSpot form doesn't work:
1. Verify Portal ID and Form ID in `lib/constants.ts`
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Test form directly on HubSpot
